                <p>In an era where data breaches are becoming more frequent and expensive, understanding and preparing for the financial implications of such incidents is crucial. This article aims to provide a detailed approach to calculating the costs associated with data breaches, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about their defense strategies and budget allocations.</p>

                <p>As Douglas Hubbard stated in 2023 "The single biggest cybersecurity risk is, I believe, that the risk assessment methods themselves are ineffectual. If these methods are nothing more than a kind of "analysis placebo" then risk mitigations will be misguided, resources will be wasted, and risks will not actually be reduced. The biggest vulnerabilities in cybersecurity are these broken, but widely used, risk assessment methods. This means the highest priority patch is building a better risk assessment method. And all the research consistently points to the same solutions: move away from ambiguous "high/medium/low" labels and adopt quantitative methods that have been shown to improve estimates and decisions measurably".</p>

                <p>Hubbard made this claim in the work of Jesus Caetano, an Antwerp Management School researcher who examined as a global CISO of a large multinational how he could better balance security efforts against his biggest Cyber risks. This work demonstrates the need for accurate risk quantification of security breaches' and financial impact have Increased in attention.</p>

                <p>To effectively counteract threats like phishing, ransomware, and other forms of cyberattacks, it's essential to choose the right protective measures. Understanding the potential costs of risk is vital in balancing risks and making informed budgetary decisions.</p>

                <p>This article focuses on quantifying the risk of data breaches using data from sources like IBM, Ponemon, and scientific literature. Data breaches will act as an example of quantifying risk. However, with the right data, you can also use the same techniques to model against other types of risks.</p>

                <p>In a later stage of the article, we highlight how you can model yourself and how you can model company specific variables. Such as security measures that you already have or want to implement. We also link the return on security investment to provide better insight into where to gain "the biggest bang for the security buck".</p>
